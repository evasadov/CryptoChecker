<h1>Crypto Checker v1.0</h1>

<h4> 
	A Crypto checker I made for fun, because I was impressed and wanted to learn more about web-scraping. 
	This program allows the user to add Cryptos from coinmarketcap, with the price they invested at and the name of the crypto. 
	When running for the first time, BTC only appears and a default value of seconds between each check is set to 300 (seconds).
